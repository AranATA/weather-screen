## description

***
 This is an application that allows users to follow the weather forecast of different locations they pick. It is featuring a dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code - and retrieves the weather data from OpenWeather API.<br>
 Third-party APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. Developers are often tasked with retrieving data from another application's API and using it in the context of their own.

## acceptance criteria

***

The codebase achieves the following criteria:<br>

* GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs:<br>
* WHEN I search for a city; THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history<br>
* WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city; THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index<br>
* WHEN I view the UV index; THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe<br>
* WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city; THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity<br>
* WHEN I click on a city in the search history; THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city<br>
